# letterboxdclone

A partial letterboxd clone written with React and .NET Core 3.1 and MS SQL. This project does not include all features of letterboxd, and was mainly written as practice.

User authentication has been implemented by using JSON Web Tokens. It's also possible for the user to log a movie, create a list of movies, write a review, comment on a review etc.

For admin panel "Material Dashboard 2" has been used as template, I have removed many of the features and implemented it for mainly CRUD operations.
